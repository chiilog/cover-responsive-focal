Extend WordPress Cover blocks with device-specific focal points for mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness. Gutenberg-standard compliant.

== Description ==

Cover Responsive Focal extends the standard WordPress Cover block to support device-specific focal points, allowing you to set different background image positions for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. This ensures optimal image display across all screen sizes without compromising backward compatibility.

**Key Features:**

* **Device-Specific Settings**: Set different focal points for Mobile (â‰¤600px) and Tablet (601px-782px)
* **Gutenberg Standards Compliant**: Follows official WordPress breakpoint specifications
* **100% Backward Compatible**: Existing Cover blocks work exactly as before
* **Real-Time Preview**: See changes instantly with editor device preview buttons
* **Lightweight & Optimized**: Minimal markup, CSS optimization with caching
* **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with intuitive interface

**Supported Breakpoints:**

Following [Gutenberg's official breakpoint standards](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/base-styles/_breakpoints.scss):

* **Mobile**: 600px and below
* **Tablet**: 601px to 782px
* **Desktop**: 783px and above (uses standard focal point)

**Perfect For:**

* **Content Creators**: Optimize hero images for mobile without technical knowledge
* **Web Designers**: Precise responsive control without custom CSS
* **Theme Developers**: Enhanced responsive capabilities for client projects
* **Marketing Teams**: Ensure brand messages remain visible on all devices

**Technical Highlights:**

* Built with TypeScript + React using WordPress Gutenberg components
* Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage
* CSS optimization: minification, duplicate media query merging, caching
* Security-first: XSS prevention, input validation, sanitization
* Performance optimized: Sub-200ms CSS generation, minimal memory footprint

== How It Works ==

1. **Add Cover Block**: Create a Cover block and add your background image as usual
2. **Open Responsive Settings**: Find "Responsive Focal Point" in the block inspector
3. **Enable Device Settings**: Toggle mobile or tablet focal points on/off
4. **Set Focal Points**: Use the visual picker to set optimal positions
5. **Preview Results**: Use editor preview buttons to see changes instantly

The plugin generates optimized CSS media queries that override the default focal point only for specified devices, ensuring perfect fallback behavior.

**Requirements:**

* WordPress 6.8 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* Modern browser with CSS `object-position` support
